        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups egg noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>



    </ol>
